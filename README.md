# Invioce_generator_GSh_JS

In this repository, I collected scripts for GoogleSheets AppScrips that generate invoices based on their draft. 

Data about potential clients and students is stored on a separate sheet "Date". 
Also on the "Date" sheet there are buttons for launching separate processes for generating data about classes held, generating invoices and generating PDF files with invoices. 

Data about the number of classes held is collected from Google Calendar using the ":" marker on the "Calculate" sheet (the student's name is formed from the characters found before the ":" in the Google Calendar event).
